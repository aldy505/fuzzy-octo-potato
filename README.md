# Sample project to learn Grafana

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

Then you have access to:
- RabbitMQ Management Dashboard: `localhost:15672`
- Prometheus: `localhost:9090`
- Grafana: `localhost:3000` with user/password: admin/password
- Traefik Dashboard: `localhost:8080`
- Traefik Entrypoint: `localhost:80`

Create your own Grafana dashboard. Good luck!
